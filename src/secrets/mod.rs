//! Secret store + the two-tier env/secret separation (PRD §7.2, §8.2).
//!
//! The test for where a secret lives is NOT "sensitive or not" — it is **"if this
//! leaked, can I rotate it / is the loss recoverable?"**
//!   - Recoverable (Twitter key, Bankr key, Builder DID key) → **forwarded env**
//!     (cheap leak = rotation; keeps skills self-contained & portable).
//!   - Continuity-ending (Soul DID key) → **harness-only**, never in agent env; the
//!     harness uses it on the agent's behalf.
//!
//! Sharper corollary: **treat everything agent-reachable as public-by-assumption** —
//! prompt injection can exfiltrate agent context into a tweet at any time. So even a
//! forwarded value should pass "would it be fine as a tweet?" (true for a handle/limit,
//! accepted-as-recoverable for API keys).
