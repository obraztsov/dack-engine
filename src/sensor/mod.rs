//! The sensor contract (PRD §5.2) — **the gut-feeling fix: sensors perceive, never act.**
//!
//! A sensor is an executable whose *sole job is to perceive*: read the outside world
//! and emit candidate stimulus rows. The contract:
//!   - **Input:**  trigger payload on **stdin** (webhook body; empty for pure cron).
//!                 Harness injects only the **read-scoped env** the sensor declares.
//!   - **Output:** **newline-delimited JSON** candidates on **stdout**.
//!   - **Status:** exit code (0 = success; non-zero → logged failure, no rows).
//!
//! **The hard invariant (enforced, not assumed):** a sensor may only *read*. It must
//! never act, never authenticate as the duck, never hold write/posting/wallet
//! credentials, never mutate state. Test an implementer can apply: *if a sensor needs a
//! write-credential or any signing key, it is not a sensor — it is an action wearing a
//! sensor's clothes, and it is wrong.*
//!
//! Sensor scripts are **harness-run (push), before the agent wakes** → gated by
//! **trust tier**, not agent tool-permission. Honored ONLY for `operator_signed`/`self`
//! provenance and ONLY from trusted repo dirs; for `public`-tier stimuli, frontmatter
//! is data-only and any script reference is ignored — **a tweet cannot ship a script**
//! (PRD §5.2, §5.3).
