//! The **Baton** — the firebreak made structural (PRD §6.4).
//!
//! The one piece of data that is neither cleanly harness-owned nor agent-owned: it
//! is *in flight* between two agent invocations, mediated by the harness. The
//! governing rule: the Baton carries the agent's **own digested products** plus the
//! harness's **trusted provenance metadata** — never the raw untrusted bytes. Raw
//! untrusted content is reachable only *by reference* (`runlog_ref`), only
//! *framed-as-untrusted*, never *auto-inlined* into the tool-bearing context.
//!
//! What it covers: contamination *carried across* (verbatim "ignore previous
//! instructions…" never rides into Express). What it does NOT cover: a malicious
//! *conclusion* carried across (the laundered-plan attack) — that residual class is
//! caught only by bounded blast radius and the irreversibility wall (PRD §7.6), never
//! by context reset. Do not let this drift to over-confidence.
