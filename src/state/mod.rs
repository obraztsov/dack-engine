//! Consciousness states — the security model, hardcoded (PRD §4, architecture §2).
//!
//! A consciousness state = an OpenClaude invocation with a fixed
//! **(system prompt + allowed-tool set + model)** triple plus a set of writable dirs.
//! The harness owns these triples; **the agent cannot widen them**. States are
//! hardcoded *because they are the security model*; only the *routing between them*
//! is operator config (the product-iteration surface).
//!
//! The cut is by **reversibility**, not by "does it write memory":
//!   - Perceive  — read-only, can't act (digests untrusted input → a typed proposal)
//!   - Express   — reversible writes (post/reply + memory-append)
//!   - Settle    — irreversible (EVM tx / vote) — THE wall; unreachable in v1
//!   - Reflect   — modifies soul/skills/stimuli/prompts; harness-entered & -exited only
