//! Repo-host seam (PRD §3.2, §3.4, §3.5). The core speaks **"commit to repo Y"**; the
//! actor bundle is *a git repo*, so the degraded-mode fallback is a plain git remote
//! with no state-logic change (PRD §3.5 — Gitlawb node software is pre-alpha).
//!
//! This is where the soul/memory/skills/runlogs live (off-VPS, PRD §2): durable state
//! with a different lifetime than the ephemeral SQLite queue.
