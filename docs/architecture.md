# Architecture

dack-engine is a single Rust crate that runs one autonomous agent as a durable actor. It splits into
two halves: a **dumb, deterministic ingestion layer** that turns events into queued stimuli, and a
**consciousness loop** that pops the queue and drives the model through the wall. The model itself runs
out-of-process behind a thin TypeScript bridge.

                                                              stimuli, skills) — signed commits
```

## Ingestion layer

The half of the harness that touches attacker-influenced bytes. Everything here is **data**, never an
instruction; the firebreak sits downstream at Perceive.

- **Sources** (`src/sources/`) feed a single `FiredTrigger` channel. A **cron wheel** fires scheduled
  duties; a **webhook listener** (localhost-only, `webhook_addr`) accepts POSTs from local adapters.
- **Sensors** (`src/sensor/`) are the duty's optional fetch step — a script the harness runs with a
  read-scoped env (plus any provider-materialized secret token) to pull new items. A webhook duty
  needs no sensor: the POSTed body is already the payload.
- **The bus** (`src/bus/`) normalizes each candidate into a `Stimulus`, applies the duty's **coalesce**
  policy (fold a burst into one wake, optionally debounced), seeds its **trust tier** from the source
  (provenance), and enqueues it.
- **The queue** (`src/queue/`) is embedded SQLite — durable across restarts, single source of pending
  work. It supports priority ordering, exact-once leasing, batch coalescing, and a per-row debounce
  gate.

## Consciousness loop

`src/harness/` pops one stimulus at a time (single-flight — the agent never runs two cycles at once)
and dispatches it:

1. Resolve the stimulus's **entry state-prompt** and open a cycle there.
2. Assemble the invocation: the soul prompts as the system prompt, the digested context as user
   content, and the **MCP capabilities** the state-prompt requests ∩ what `tier_policy` admits ∩ what
   the cycle's current trust permits.
3. Invoke the runtime. Every tool the model calls is relayed back through **the wall**
   (`src/runtime/action_required.rs` + `src/state/`), which decides allow/deny by tool class, current
   state, and the path gate, and records each call in the runlog.
4. The model returns a structured output (a thought, an intent, an optional transition). The harness
   walks to the chosen transition if the cycle's trust ceiling reaches it, else terminates.

Harness-owned background tasks run alongside the loop: the **Reflect scheduler** (enqueues the nightly
self-modification run), the **modules supervisor** (keeps channel adapters alive), and the **stimuli
watcher** (hot-reloads the soul's duties).

## The runtime bridge

The model runs out-of-process. `src/runtime/` defines a `RuntimeClient` trait; the wired
implementation spawns `bun run bridge.ts` (`openclaude-bridge/`), which drives the OpenClaude SDK and
speaks a small JSON protocol over stdio: one invocation in, a stream of permission events out (each
answered by the wall), and a final structured result. A pipe to a child is more confined than a
localhost socket — nothing binds, nothing is impersonable.

The runtime is an **extensibility seam**: `runtime.engine` chooses the agent runtime and
`runtime.connector` chooses how it reaches models (an OpenAI-compatible gateway today). Swapping either
is a config edit, not a code change. See [configuration](configuration.md#runtime).

## The sandbox seam

Subprocesses (sensors, the bridge, modules, workers) are spawned through a `Sandbox` trait
(`src/sandbox/`). The default `HostSandbox` runs them directly; a `DockerSandbox` maps an isolation
policy to `docker run` flags. This is how delegated **workers** get OS-level isolation
(see [workers](workers.md)) and where future sensor/container hardening slots in.

## The soul repo

The agent's durable identity is a git repository — the **soul** — separate from this source tree
(`soul-template/` is a starting template). It holds the agent's prompts, memory, stimuli, skills, and
runlogs. The harness commits to it as the agent's own DID and (optionally) pushes signed updates to a
Gitlawb node, so the agent's history is cryptographically attributable to it. An **integrity tripwire**
reverts any change to the soul made outside a Reflect cycle, so self-modification stays gated.

See [authoring souls](authoring-souls.md) for the bundle layout and [operations](operations.md) for the
signing/identity setup.

## Module map

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/sources/` | cron wheel + webhook listener → one `FiredTrigger` channel |
| `src/sensor/` | run a duty's fetch script under a read-scoped sandbox |
| `src/bus/` | normalize → coalesce → seed trust → enqueue |
| `src/queue/` | embedded SQLite queue (durable, leased, coalescing, debounce) |
| `src/harness/` | the consciousness loop, dispatch, the wall integration, modules, workers, Reflect |
| `src/state/` + `src/state_prompt.rs` | consciousness states, tool classes, state-prompt parsing |
| `src/runtime/` | the `RuntimeClient` seam + the OpenClaude bridge driver + the wall responder |
| `src/sandbox/` | the `Sandbox` seam (host / docker) |
| `src/config/` | `dack.config.yaml` parsing + the trust lattice |
| `src/secrets/` | secrets-provider broker |
| `src/repo/` | the soul git host (plain-git / signed `gitlawb://`) |
| `src/identity/` | `gl` identity resolution + signing |
| `src/runlog/` | the agent "syslog" |
| `src/stimuli/` | duty (`STIMULUS.md`) registry + hot-reload |
| `src/webserver/` | the localhost webhook listener |
| `src/model/` | the core domain types (Stimulus, Baton, proposal, runlog) |

For the design rationale behind these choices, see [docs/internal/](internal/) (the original PRD and
architecture notes).
