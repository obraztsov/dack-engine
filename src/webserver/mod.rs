//! Webhook listener (PRD §2, §5.1) — the inbound HTTP surface for `webhook`-triggered
//! duties. A POST matching a duty's `trigger.path` causes the harness to run that duty's
//! sensor with the request body on stdin, then feed the bus.
//!
//! v1 impl: [`axum_listener::AxumWebhookListener`], bound **localhost-only** alongside the
//! gRPC client (the box exposes nothing public except what a reverse proxy chooses to). A
//! matched POST emits a `FiredTrigger` onto the shared channel the harness drains; the body
//! is always `public`-tier payload — data only, never a script (PRD §5.3).
