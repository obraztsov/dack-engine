# Operations

Running, observing, and maintaining a live agent.

## CLI reference

All commands are `dack <command>` (or `cargo run --release -- <command>`).

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `dack run` | Boot the harness and process stimuli — the long-running actor. Runs the ingestion loop, the consciousness loop, the modules supervisor, and the Reflect scheduler until stopped. |
| `dack say "<text>"` | Inject a trusted `operator_signed` instruction into the queue (signed with the operator key, verified against `operator_did`). |
| `dack status` | Liveness, queue depth, last run, current state. |
| `dack log [--follow]` | Tail the runlog — the agent's "syslog". |
| `dack pause` | Soft kill-switch: stop popping the queue (work keeps queuing). |
| `dack resume` | Resume popping the queue. |
| `dack kill` | Hard stop. |
| `dack reflect-now` | Force a Reflect (self-modification) run now, overriding the scheduled cadence. |
| `dack reconcile` | Commit your hand-edits to the soul tree as the operator, so the integrity tripwire doesn't revert them. |

## Daemon lifecycle

`dack run` is the single process that starts the agent's whole runtime — its mind and its channels.
Run it under a process supervisor (systemd, a container restart policy) in production. It handles
SIGTERM/SIGINT gracefully: the in-flight cycle finishes, modules are torn down, and the process exits
cleanly, so a supervisor restart reclaims any orphaned work and posts a "back online" stimulus.

The queue is durable (embedded SQLite at `db_path`), so a restart loses no pending work — only the
in-flight cycle, which is reclaimed. The database is otherwise disposable: deleting it loses only the
queue, not the agent (its identity and memory live in the soul repo).

## Observing a run

The **runlog** (`<soul>/runlogs/<date>.md`) is the durable record of every cycle: the model's thought,
each tool it called with the wall's verdict (allow / deny / dry-run), the transition it took, and the
raw stimulus (clearly marked as untrusted). `dack log --follow` tails it. Because it's committed to the
soul repo, the agent's full operational history is attributable to it and inspectable after the fact.

`dack status` gives the at-a-glance view: is it alive, how deep is the queue, what was the last run.

## The soul repo

The agent's durable identity is a git repository (`soul_repo`), separate from the engine. The harness
commits to it after each run — the per-cycle changes (memory, any Reflect edits) plus the runlog.

It's **one local git repo**; `soul_remotes` is the list of places it's pushed after each cycle. The
backend is inferred per URL: `gitlawb://…` is a signed ref-update, anything else (`git@…`, `https://…`,
a local path) is a plain `git push`. Each target is **best-effort** unless `required: true`, so a flaky
mirror never blocks a cycle — the next cycle re-pushes. List several to get redundancy:

```yaml
soul_remotes:
  - url: "git@github.com:youruser/my-soul.git"        # reliable primary
    required: true
  - url: "gitlawb://did:key:<soul-did>/my-soul"        # decentralized mirror, best-effort
    identity: soul
```

- **Local-only.** Omit `soul_remotes` entirely. Commits are local; nothing is pushed.
- **Plain git (GitHub / GitLab / Gitea / self-hosted).** A normal `git push`. Commits are authored as
  the Soul DID (attribution by author identity). The most reliable option.
- **Signed push (gitlawb).** A `gitlawb://<soul-did>/<repo>` URL: each per-run commit is pushed as a
  signed ref-update to the node (`gitlawb_node`, or the entry's `node:`), signed with the key named by
  `identity:` (default `soul`). This adds cryptographic, node-verifiable provenance on top of authorship.

The legacy single `soul_remote:` field still works — it's treated as a one-element best-effort list.

### Pushing to a GitHub (or any plain-git) remote

GitHub transport auth is **separate from the soul DID** — GitHub doesn't understand DIDs, so the DID
keys don't grant push. The DID stays the commit *author*; you authenticate the *push* with ordinary
GitHub credentials:

- **SSH (simplest).** Add a deploy key (or your machine's SSH key) to the repo on GitHub, and use the
  `git@github.com:owner/repo.git` URL. No token in config — the ambient SSH key authenticates.
- **HTTPS token.** Create a fine-grained PAT with `contents: write` on that repo, export it in the
  daemon's environment (e.g. `GITHUB_TOKEN`), and reference it with `auth: { token_env: GITHUB_TOKEN }`.
  The token is read at push time and injected as an ephemeral credential — never written to disk, never
  on a command line, never in the agent's context.

The repo must already exist on GitHub (create it empty, no auto-README, to avoid a non-fast-forward on
the first push).

### Identities

`gl` identity directories provide the signing keys, one per role:

```yaml
identities:
  soul: "identities/soul"          # signs soul commits + the gitlawb push; NEVER in agent env
  operator: "identities/operator"  # signs `dack say`
  builder: "identities/builder"
```

Create each with `gl identity new --dir identities/<role>` (each directory holds `identity.pem` +
`ucan.json`). **Gitignore `/identities/`** — these are private keys. The Soul key in particular is
harness-only: it signs the agent's commits but is never forwarded into the agent's environment, so the
model can never sign as itself.

## Hand-editing the soul

The harness runs an **integrity tripwire**: after each cycle it reverts any change to the soul made
outside a Reflect run (this is what keeps self-modification gated to Reflect). If *you* edit the soul
by hand — tweak a prompt, add a duty, fix memory — the tripwire would revert it on the next cycle. Run
`dack reconcile` first: it commits your tracked edits as the operator, so the tripwire treats them as
intended.

Files the soul gitignores (worker `workspaces/`, secrets) are invisible to the tripwire and never
reverted.

## Self-modification cadence

Reflect runs are rate-limited by `reflect_min_interval_secs` (default daily), enforced for both the
scheduled run (`reflect_schedule`) and any Reflect reached by a transition. `dack reflect-now` is the
manual override. Because Reflect is the only state that can write the agent's own prompts, this cadence
bounds how fast the agent changes itself.

## Channels

Long-running channel adapters run as `modules` under the supervisor — they start and stop with
`dack run`, restart on failure, and need no separate process management. See [channels](channels.md).

## Workers

Delegated workers run on the host by default. To OS-isolate them in Docker, build the worker image and
enable `runtime.worker_sandbox`; see [workers](workers.md). Worker `workspaces/` are swept at boot.

## Production checklist

- Gitignore `dack.config.yaml`, `/identities/`, `/secrets/`, and the soul's `workspaces/`.
- Run `dack run` under a supervisor with a restart policy.
- Set `soul_remote` + `identities.soul` for signed, attributable history.
- Keep the model endpoint reachable; a hung invocation elapses at `invoke_timeout_secs` and the loop
  continues rather than freezing.
- Use `dry_run` to rehearse outward actions before going live.
